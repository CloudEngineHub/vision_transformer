Please refer to that page for a detailed explanation how a LiT model works. </p><p> Below you can choose an image from a selection and then write free-form text prompts that are matched to the image. Once you hit return on your keyboard or press the "compute" button, a text encoder implemented in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js/"> TensorFlow.js </a> will compute embeddings for the provided text on your local device, and the similarity of these text embeddings to the image embedding will be displayed. </p><p> The prompts can be used to classify an image into multiple categories, listing each category individually with a prompt "an image of a X". But you can also probe the model interactively with more detailed prompts, comparing the different results when small details change in the text. </p><p> Please use this demo responsibly. The models will always compare the image to the prompts you provide, and it is therefore trivial to construct situations where the model picks from a bunch of bad options. </p><p class="note warning"> <b>Note:</b> The models available in this interactive demo are <b>not</b> those from the paper. We had to train much smaller text towers and tokenizers to avoid overloading your browser. Please see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer">our GitHub repository</a> for the models from the paper pre-trained on public datasets. </p><pre id="messages"></pre><p> </p><pre id="messages"></pre><div id="examples">Javascript is loading...</div>
